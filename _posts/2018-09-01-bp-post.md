My Bachelor thesis is named "Recognising fake news in digital space". 

In my thesis I have analysed existing solutions to the problem of recognising which news are not true. During my research I found out none of the solutions are really dependable.

That is why I focused my own work on identifying which news and messages have the most lie-spreading potential and then prioritize fact-checking the most viral news.
This solution uses not only the possibility of going viral, but also leverages the crowd and users' ability to mark content as fake. 
That allows us to reduce as much disinformation spreading as possible without trying to guess whether the article itself is true or false as existing algorithms do not work that well yet.

Hopefully I'll finish it in time.
